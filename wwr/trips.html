            We will provide one guide per party, but if there are a lot more beginners we can provide 1 guide per boat for a party if they are less experienced.

            <p class="gi24dp">
            Since this is a trip containing more experienced rafters, only one guide per party is needed. But we do expect all rafters to act safely on the water no matter how experienced you are. 

             </p>
            <h3 class="gi72d">72 Hour Trip</h3>
            <p class="gi72dp">
            This is a special trip reserved well in advance so the guide can inspect and plot the route and prep it so you get the best experience possible. One guide per party, and your guide is to be listened to at all times so all rafters can enjoy the thoughtful preparation that went into making this trip be the best it can be.
