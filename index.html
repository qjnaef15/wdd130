        <img src="images/quentin.png" alt="Hello my name is Quentin Naef" width="200">
        <p> My name is Quentin Naef. I am from Pasco Washington and I am a CIT major with an empasis in Cyber Security. I am the oldest of 5, so you could say that I have always been the trial and error kid for my parents.
            I served my mission in Baltimore Maryland Mission, and also Washington DC North Mission. Some interesting facts about me is I made an acapella group with some friends
            and we audtioned to be the opening act for BYU Vocalpoint in Cour Dea'lane idaho and we won. I would say that my favorite hobbies can vary depending what I am in the mood for.
            One day I will want to be playing sports like vlleyball and basketball, and the next day I would rather chill and watch a movie or play games with my friends. I chose my major because my dad is a Software Engineer
            and I grew up around the industry. I love learning everything you can do with computers and they have always fascinated me. I can't wait to learn with you all in this class!</p>

        <p> I live in Pasco Washington which is a desert valley in the great State of Washington. Don't confuse us with the rainy and green trees side of Washington.
            We are very different from that side. We are well known for our rivers and agriculture, lots of boating races and fun things to do. </p>
